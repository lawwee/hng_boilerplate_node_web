## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager, included with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Contribution Guide

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/[app-name].git
cd [app-name]
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your environment-specific variables. You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a reference.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to match your environment configuration.

### 4. Compile TypeScript

Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript.

```sh
npm run build
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

Start the development server with the following command. This will also watch for any changes in your code and automatically restart the server.

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

### 6. Run the Production Server

To run the application in a production environment, use the following command:

```sh
npm run start
```

### 7. Verify the Setup

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/` to verify that the application is running correctly.


## Scripts

Here are some useful npm scripts that you can use during development and production:

- `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
- `npm run start:dev`: Starts the development server with live reloading.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server.
- `npm run test`: Runs the test suite (if available).
- `npm run lint`: Runs the linter to check for code style issues.

## Additional Resources

- [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [Express Documentation](https://expressjs.com/)

By following these steps, you should have your Node.js and TypeScript application up and running. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the documentation of the respective tools or seek help from the community.
